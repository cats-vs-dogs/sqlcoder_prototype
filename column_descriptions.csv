Banks have to consider the MoC (margin of conservatism) in the estimation of the risk parameters. The MoC aims at addressing deficiencies and any other uncertainty related to the estimation of the risk parameters and has to be added to the risk parameter in the regulatory/ internal risk calculation.
For the IFRS9 LLP calculation the MoC doesn’t need to be considered, as the IFRS9 rules require risk parameters without margin of conservatism.

The economic loss for the bank is the residual exposure not recovered at the end of the workout period plus the direct and indirect workout costs and the time value. The [LGD Liquidation] is calculated using an appropriate regressive model depending on the different LGD products (classes), e.g. overdraft, long term loans, derivatives, mortgage loans etc. 

Remark: The Italian local LGD Models used to calculate the LGD on performing exposures considers three stages of default: past due, “incaglio” (doubtful/restructuring loan), “sofferenza” (liquidation status). The final LGD at transaction level is calculated as weighted average of the single LGD default status at transaction level.

For the IFRS9 LLP calculation the MoC doesn’t need to be considered, as the IFRS9 rules require risk parameters without margin of conservatism.

NB: In the case of avals, the avals that have been extended must be entered, i.e. returns and utilizations are already taken into account here.
For pledge/session: The nominal amount underlying the derivative transaction comprising the basis for the claim to payment. In case of derivative transactions with two notional amounts (e.g. foreign exchange options), the asset-side notional amount must be given. For example, in the case of forward currency transactions and options, this field contains the delivery claim translated into EUR. The currency of the delivery claim is entered in the field [Original currency of notional amount]. For forward currency transactions, the field [Key: transaction alignment] in [Transaction] always refers to this notional amount, and therefore always has the 'buy' value.
For options with swaps with varying capital amounts, the so-called effective capital amount on the asset set must be given: This is generally the maximum notional amount applicable to the outstanding interest period.
For instruments: The nominal amount of the [Instrument] in question. For baskets, the percentages of the individual instruments are also represented. If multiple defaults of individual instruments in a basket are possible, then the total notional amounts of the individual instruments may exceed the notional amount of the basket.
For cash components: The nominal amount is the capital amount of a [Cash component] agreed when the contract is signed. For swaps with a notional amount that varies over the maturity, the maximum notional amount over the remaining maturity must be entered. For swap transactions, the notional amounts of both swap legs must be represented using two [Cash components]."

NB: In the case of avals, the avals that have been extended must be entered, i.e. returns and utilizations are already taken into account here.
For pledge/session: The nominal amount underlying the derivative transaction comprising the basis for the claim to payment. In case of derivative transactions with two notional amounts (e.g. foreign exchange options), the asset-side notional amount must be given. For example, in the case of forward currency transactions and options, this field contains the delivery claim translated into EUR. The currency of the delivery claim is entered in the field [Original currency of notional amount]. For forward currency transactions, the field [Key: transaction alignment] in [Transaction] always refers to this notional amount, and therefore always has the 'buy' value.
For options with swaps with varying capital amounts, the so-called effective capital amount on the asset set must be given: This is generally the maximum notional amount applicable to the outstanding interest period.
For instruments: The nominal amount of the [Instrument] in question. For baskets, the percentages of the individual instruments are also represented. If multiple defaults of individual instruments in a basket are possible, then the total notional amounts of the individual instruments may exceed the notional amount of the basket.
For cash components: The nominal amount is the capital amount of a [Cash component] agreed when the contract is signed. For swaps with a notional amount that varies over the maturity, the maximum notional amount over the remaining maturity must be entered. For swap transactions, the notional amounts of both swap legs must be represented using two [Cash components]."

Banks have to consider the MoC (margin of conservatism) in the estimation of the risk parameters. The MoC aims at addressing deficiencies and any other uncertainty related to the estimation of the risk parameters and has to be added to the risk parameter in the regulatory/ internal risk calculation.
For the IFRS9 LLP calculation the MoC doesn’t need to be considered, as the IFRS9 rules require risk parameters without margin of conservatism.

NB: In the case of avals, the avals that have been extended must be entered, i.e. returns and utilizations are already taken into account here.
For pledge/session: The nominal amount underlying the derivative transaction comprising the basis for the claim to payment. In case of derivative transactions with two notional amounts (e.g. foreign exchange options), the asset-side notional amount must be given. For example, in the case of forward currency transactions and options, this field contains the delivery claim translated into EUR. The currency of the delivery claim is entered in the field [Original currency of notional amount]. For forward currency transactions, the field [Key: transaction alignment] in [Transaction] always refers to this notional amount, and therefore always has the 'buy' value.
For options with swaps with varying capital amounts, the so-called effective capital amount on the asset set must be given: This is generally the maximum notional amount applicable to the outstanding interest period.
For instruments: The nominal amount of the [Instrument] in question. For baskets, the percentages of the individual instruments are also represented. If multiple defaults of individual instruments in a basket are possible, then the total notional amounts of the individual instruments may exceed the notional amount of the basket.
For cash components: The nominal amount is the capital amount of a [Cash component] agreed when the contract is signed. For swaps with a notional amount that varies over the maturity, the maximum notional amount over the remaining maturity must be entered. For swap transactions, the notional amounts of both swap legs must be represented using two [Cash components]."

NB: In the case of avals, the avals that have been extended must be entered, i.e. returns and utilizations are already taken into account here.
For pledge/session: The nominal amount underlying the derivative transaction comprising the basis for the claim to payment. In case of derivative transactions with two notional amounts (e.g. foreign exchange options), the asset-side notional amount must be given. For example, in the case of forward currency transactions and options, this field contains the delivery claim translated into EUR. The currency of the delivery claim is entered in the field [Original currency of notional amount]. For forward currency transactions, the field [Key: transaction alignment] in [Transaction] always refers to this notional amount, and therefore always has the 'buy' value.
For options with swaps with varying capital amounts, the so-called effective capital amount on the asset set must be given: This is generally the maximum notional amount applicable to the outstanding interest period.
For instruments: The nominal amount of the [Instrument] in question. For baskets, the percentages of the individual instruments are also represented. If multiple defaults of individual instruments in a basket are possible, then the total notional amounts of the individual instruments may exceed the notional amount of the basket.
For cash components: The nominal amount is the capital amount of a [Cash component] agreed when the contract is signed. For swaps with a notional amount that varies over the maturity, the maximum notional amount over the remaining maturity must be entered. For swap transactions, the notional amounts of both swap legs must be represented using two [Cash components]."

Buchwert;NUMBER_15_2;n;n;n;y;Book value;In case of an asset-side transaction, the book value of a banking transaction is the amount the customer owes the bank on the reporting date, excluding the cash discount (i.e. the positive accrual of the cash discount must be added to the negative claim), excluding prepaid interest, prepaid fees, prepaid cash discount amounts and accrued undue fees. In case of a liability-side transaction, the book value is the amount the bank owes the customer on the reporting date, excluding accrued undue fees. The balance of the book value contains due (overdue) and undue amounts. Note: the book value for banking transactions can be found in the entity 'Balance' The book value of the general-ledger accounts (internal accounts) can also be found in the entity 'Balance'. As a rule, the book value of securities and equities is the balance-sheet value of the securities or equity shares (e.g. shares in a limited liability company) on the reporting date. Special aspect of repo/lending transactions: for individual lending and repurchase transactions, the value of the loaned or repurchased securities calculated at the settlement price can be given instead of the balance-sheet value. The book value for leasing transactions corresponds to the leasing assets shown in the balance sheet (if the leasing company prepares the balance sheet). The book value must be stated pursuant to the accounting law used.

For pledge/session: The nominal amount underlying the derivative transaction comprising the basis for the claim to payment. In case of derivative transactions with two notional amounts (e.g. foreign exchange options), the asset-side notional amount must be given. For example, in the case of forward currency transactions and options, this field contains the delivery claim translated into EUR. The currency of the delivery claim is entered in the field [Original currency of notional amount]. For forward currency transactions, the field [Key: transaction alignment] in [Transaction] always refers to this notional amount, and therefore always has the 'buy' value.
For options with swaps with varying capital amounts, the so-called effective capital amount on the asset set must be given: This is generally the maximum notional amount applicable to the outstanding interest period.
For instruments: The nominal amount of the [Instrument] in question. For baskets, the percentages of the individual instruments are also represented. If multiple defaults of individual instruments in a basket are possible, then the total notional amounts of the individual instruments may exceed the notional amount of the basket.
For cash components: The nominal amount is the capital amount of a [Cash component] agreed when the contract is signed. For swaps with a notional amount that varies over the maturity, the maximum notional amount over the remaining maturity must be entered. For swap transactions, the notional amounts of both swap legs must be represented using two [Cash components]."
